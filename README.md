# 70 years of Formula 1 - An Exploratory Data Analysis -->

### Introduction:
- Formula 1, the pinnacle of motorsports, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year.
- This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on the 70-year history of Formula 1.

### About the project:
- The analysis focuses on driver and constructor records, as well as other aspects of Formula 1.
- Numpy and Pandas libraries are used for data exploration, while Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used for data visualization.

### Dataset:
- The dataset consists of 13 files, with various Ids connecting them.
- The data is well-organized, and data cleaning is skipped for the time being.

### Features:
- Races: Analyzing the Formula 1 races, sorting them chronologically, and removing upcoming races.
- Circuits: Exploring the circuits that have hosted Formula 1 races.
- Constructors: Examining the players in the constructor business and counting the race entries for each team.
- Drivers: Analyzing driver representation in Formula 1 and comparing driver stats.

### Descriptive summary:
- Determining the total number of championship races completed in Formula 1.
- Visualizing the trend in the number of championship races held per season over 70 years.
- Identifying the circuits that have hosted Formula 1 races and finding the top 10 circuits with the most Grand Prix races.
- Exploring the countries that have hosted Formula 1 races over the years.
- Analyzing the number of race entries and victories for each team.
- Examining the number of race victories for all constructors and calculating win percentages.
- Investigating the constructor championship titles and the teams' performances.
- Analyzing driver representation in Formula 1 and counting the number of countries with driver representation.
- Finding the most experienced driver in terms of races entered and laps raced.
- Comparing the stats of five renowned drivers: Hamilton, Schumacher, Senna, Prost, and Fangio.
- Visualizing Lewis Hamilton's wins across the years.

### Data Visualization:
- Using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visualizations for races, circuits, constructors, and drivers.

### Insights and Exploration:
- Uncovering insights about Formula 1 races, circuits, constructors, and drivers through data analysis and visualization.

### Recommendations:
- Providing recommendations for future exploration and analysis of the Formula 1 dataset.

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of Formula 1, covering various aspects such as races, circuits, constructors, and drivers. The analysis offers insights into the history and statistics of Formula 1, along with visualizations to enhance understanding. The project opens up opportunities for further exploration and analysis of the dataset.
